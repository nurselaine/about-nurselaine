    "Bio": "Hello! My name is Elaine, I'm full-stack software engineer with an interest in web technologies. While I was working as a COVID ICU nurse in 2020, I started teaching myself how to build websites as a new hobby. Now I make web applications for my friends, family, and small businesses. I decided to pivot my career path and dive deeper into solidfying my fundementals in web development. Outside of developing and nursing, I spend my free time reading about naturopathic health, exploring new restaurants in Seattle, and most importantly is time with my family."
