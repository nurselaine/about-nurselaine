      "info": "The concept of WenJobs was a collaborative effort along with a Web3 Job Recruiter who played the role of our client. Using the concepts learned over the past six months, we developed a job board that displays updated Web3 career opportunties and connects to users LinkedIn connections to help find companies within a user's network. My focus developing this project was utilizing webscraping technologies, so users would gain access to the newest job opportunities from the most popular Web3 job boards! Having the opportunity to work with a client was a rewarding experience. I was able to build out my client's vision and gain a higher level of client-developer communication.",

      "info": "After meeting Loann who is a cosmetologist, I was motivated to create an online website to help her promote her business and also find new clients. Loann had been struggling to work with freelancer developers in the past and did not want to utilize platforms such as squarespace or wix. I decided I wanted to offer my help and create an portfolio website for her clients and prospective clients to connect with Loann. During our meetings, Loann had wanted a website that only included the most basic information as well as a way for her clients to set up appointments through SMS. She also wanted her pictures from clients as well as positive client reviews displayed on the website. While creating this portfolio, I utilized media queries to ensure the website would be responsive to provide client on a phone or laptop to be able to make appointments with Loann. I utilized Twilio to create a form that would send Loann appointment requests via a twilio phone number with client information for her to resond back to. Lastly, I decided on using Google's Firestore Database so I can eventually connect to Google's Business API to always have the most recent and newest google reviews and photos to display on Loann's portfolio.",
      "challenges": "Creating my own responsive components was a challenge that took more time and research while developing this project. I wanted to better understand how the UI components from libraries I have used in the past work, so I decided on creating my own responsive components. I started with the navigation bar that would transition to a hamburger menu at a certain breakpoint and then I utilized Flex-box and grid to ensure the columns within the application would seamlessly adjust on various viewports. I learned a great deal about the importance of responsiveness and accessibility while creating this project because I felt a deeper sense of responsibility to Loann to make sure her clients & prospective clients could easily use this website while maintaining a good user experience.",

      "challenges": "I wanted to re-create Trello using the concepts I had learned in my intro to web development course. While planning and creating data models, I found the limitations of using a non-relational database for my initial intention. After researching and understanding the pros and cons to using both relational database and NoSQL databases, I knew that I would still be able to use a NoSQL database; however, I would not be able to make complex transactions that a relational database would allow. I decided that I wanted to solidify my understanding and usage of non-relational databases and implemented Google Firestore's non-relational database. Unlike trello, Kanbrain utilizes a edit and save button due to the way I organized my non-relational database. I plan on implementing postgreSQL relational database on top of the current database, so I can transition my data into tables that I can make joins and more complex transactions between!",
      "info": "Planning has always been an essential skill that I deeply value and aim to perfect.
